# Introduction
Night Lights data (Yi et al., 2014) has been able to determine urbanization processes, and so far, we have witness expansion sets of analysis. Its’ ability to track urban sprawl expansion, the urban environment, and its’ level of activity are highly suitable. While it may detect urban expansion, the project will query its’ ability to query the contrary. 

In context, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program is a widely quoted data. It is a collection of two satellites that are solar coordinated, which one satellite is in a dawn - dusk orbit, and the second in a day - night orbit. The DMSP Operational Linescan System (OLS) data sets are utilized for this project. As stated on NOAA’s page, 

> “The wide swath widths provide for global coverage four times a day: dawn, day, dusk, night.” 

> “With sunlight eliminated, the light intensification makes it possible to detect city lights, gas flares, and fires.”

As such, the project deem its’ specific capabilities for detection for statistical data collection fit for the usage of consideration.

In reproducing the widely cited data in a standardized manner, relevant data sets were tracked down according to the inheritance after intragovernmental agencies merger. The NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) supports DoD's data archival for the DMSP sensors, which the U.S. Air Force Global Weather Central sends DMSP data to NCEI. Archival operation was established in March of 1992, and began receiving data on a daily basis in September of 1992. The mentioned time series and grandfathered collaboration across government agencies will be used for streamlining reproducible of the research, but in a compression manner.

Crucially, a city’s existence relies on its’ inhabitants, and tracking of its activity can be intermediate through lights. The population’s activity of light usage measurement a good way to detect its’ vibrancy or inactivity. Many publications have the manner of understanding it through growth phases, but the project will attempt to achieve proof on concept in a contracting manner rather than expansion, in even timed series for more contrasting effects. Therefore, the Rust Belt cities offer intriguing insights of shrinking cities and its population.


# Data {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Pulling
Firstly, the satellite images, or raster data, are downloaded from NOAA’s web page to process locally. Global Cloud Free VIIRS Cloud Mask ((VCMCFG) with average stable radiance is selected. The local processing option was chosen due to resources rationale to computation and cost effectiveness. A biannual year was selected with the month of September chosen as constant for comparison. The years selected were 2014 and 2016. Data can be downloaded at:

https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_dnb_composites.html

Secondly, the spatial projection coordinates for census shape files will be synchronized using World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum (Huang, B. 2017). The census shape files used are Core Based Statistical Areas Shape Files (CBSA) Data at 1:20,000,000 resolution. Data can be downloaded at:

https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_msa.html

Lastly, the population estimate files are downloaded for correlation, and formatted to characters, while assigned. The reason to use characters is to spur standardized readability when performing analysis. Data can be downloaded at:

# Methodology: Visualization of the Cities
As for tidying the data set, the project will utilize the libraries as commented in the codes. The loop function works by utilizing "foreach library. It will run the cities that were selected above.The visualization process will use a loop function for both years to geocode and will be assigned with relevant variables. Namely the process order is as follow:

Firstly in the loop function,  the cities will be geocoded and assigned temporarily before merged.

Secondly, the bounding box will be established before being merged with the satellite image.

Thirdly, the referenced codes (Chen, 2017) will visually inspect rasters by color coding raster values on a map using k-means clustering algorithm.

Lastly, the sampled radiance level will be plotted to reveal visually of the night lights in relevant cities.

The geocoded cities coordinates are also saved to prevent frequent queries through the ggpmap library as Google's Term of Policies limits queries. As for the files displayed, they are PNG files generated from cropping the bounding box parameters with the nightlights dotted according to spatial projection referenced.

As for faster website loading, the visualization loads the PNG files generated rather than running the processing of visualization that is computational intensive.

# Methodology: Histogram of Satellite Image (Raster Data to Vector Data Conversion)
The codes below referenced (Chen, 2017) from the guidelines given by Department of Commerce will convert GeoTIFFs to vector data. Again, it will use a loop for both years.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

  #Raster extract

  #Convert cropped raster into a vector

# Methodology: Extracting CBSA Geocoded Areas for Population and Totalling Night Lights from Radiance Data 
In order to obtain the necessary radiance statistics within the geographic boundaries specified, the five cities, the project will utilize two cores (process intensive), limited by resource capacity, to speed up the extraction process.

Once the extraction is done, it will have the sum of the total night lights with the relevant "GEOID", in this case, the CBSA areas selected. Then, the process of merging it with the Metropolitan Statistical Area's population statistic can be done.

The process described is performed for both years recursively to obtain the necessary statistics for plotting. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Plotting
#Scatterplot with Trendline of "TNL and Population"

##Year 2016
registerDoParallel(cores=2)
extract2016=foreach(i=1:nrow(msa2016@data), .combine=rbind, .packages="raster") %dopar% {
  data=histogram(msa2016,rast2016,i)
  data.frame(GEOID = data$GEOID[1],sum = sum(data$avg_rad))
}
extract2016$GEOID=as.numeric(as.character(extract2016$GEOID))

##Merge data

  data=histogram(msa2014,rast2014,i)
  data.frame(GEOID = data$GEOID[1],sum = sum(data$avg_rad))

```



#Results
Plots ,which are scatterplots, are done logarithmically due to large sum size and magnitude for Total Night Lights (TNL) against Population.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#Scatterplot with Trendline of "TNL and Population"
#Plotting for year 2014 
ggplot(merge2014, aes(log(TNL), log(Population))) +
  geom_hex() +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = log(TNL))) +
  labs(title="Total Night Time Light vs Population 2014")
```

```

# Conclusions
Total night lights in summation is a good proxy for estimating population. It is possible to merge geographically relevant areas quickly with satellite images accurately. However, the process is computationally intensive, but significant. As for achieving the objective of the project, it has proven itself as a concept. The merger of the satellite image's radiance with geocoded base maps allows quick mapping of the selected cities with their radiance level in an overall manner for comparison across time in montages.

The plotted chart clearly shows a good fit of using the sum of night lights data by DMSP OLS in relation to the population estimates by US Census Bureau, even on shrinking cities. The plot comparison between the two years show the trend line being sticky despite the drop in sum of night lights as the years goes by. 

Future studies with more time intervals and shorter time intervals would yield better detailed visualization and more insights. Provided that there is better resources for computing capacity, dynamic visualization would be inspirational for better scale and precision.
